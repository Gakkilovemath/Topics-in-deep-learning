# STAT 991: Topics in deep learning (UPenn)

This repository hosts the materials for STAT 991: Topics in Deep Learning. This is a seminar class at UPenn started in 2018. It surveys advanced topics in deep learning based on student presentations. 

The class will be offered again in Fall 2019.

The materials draw inspiration from many sources, including David Donoho's course Stat 385 at Stanford, Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course on deeplearning.ai, CS231n at Stanford, David Silver's RL course, Tony Cai's reading group at Wharton. They may contain factual and typographical errors. Thanks to several people who have provided parts of the notes, including Zongyu Dai, Georgios Kissas, Jane Lee, Barry Plunkett, Matteo Sordello, Yibo Yang, Bo Zhang, Yi Zhang, Carolina Zheng.
